		<p>Free Fire is a battle royale game developed and published by Garena for Android and iOS devices. One of the gameâ€™s key differentiators is its ability to run on a wider range of smartphone devices. PUBG Mobile is not recommended for use on smartphones with less than 2GB of RAM, whereas Free Fire is playable on devices with 1GB RAM or higher. This optimization for low-end devices coupled with the smaller file size of the game, positioned it as the PUBG Mobile alternative tailor-made for emerging markets.</p>
